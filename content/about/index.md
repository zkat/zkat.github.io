# About Me

My name is Kat March√°n, and I'm a software engineer and open source
maintainer. I write a lot of Rust these days, and I'm the maintainer of a few
popular crates, like [`miette`](https://crates.io/crates/miette) and
[`big-brain`](https://crates.io/crates/big-brain). I'm also the original
author and part of the group continuing to maintain the [KDL Document
Language](https://kdl.dev), and as part of that I also maintain the main Rust
implementation, [`kdl-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/kdl).

In a previous life, I was the lead maintainer for the [NPM
CLI](https://github.com/npm/cli), as well as the creator of the included
[`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) tool everyone knows and
loves.

I also founded and maintain [Banchan Art](https://banchan.art), a [Platform
Co-operative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative) meant to
empower artists to sell art commissions safely and fairly on a platform they
control.

Aside from my codey work, I'm also a drummer, a wannabe artist, a wife, and a
mother of one wonderful human child and three orange furball kitties.

## About This Site

This is my personal site, occasional (?) blog, and a place where I can share
things like my tabletop RPG campaigns, art, and other projects. It's built on
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) using the
[eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) because I am
lazy so yell at them if you don't like the site itself.

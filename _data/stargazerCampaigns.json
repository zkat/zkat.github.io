Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start.\n\nIn this final war, we were set upon by:\nA tyrannical faction or leader. \n","exodus":"When the Exodus fleet set off on a ponderous journey to a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as their destination. Countless generations lived out their lives aboard those titanic ships during the millennia-long passage. The refugees built a rich legacy of culture and tradition during the Exodus. Some even remained in the ships after their arrival in the Forge, unwilling or unable to leave their familiar confines. Those vessels, the Ironhomes, still sail the depths of this galaxy.","communities":"Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.","iron":"Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron. Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.","laws":"Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognized, and supersedes local laws. Through tradition and influence, bounty hunter guilds are given free rein to track and capture fugitives in most settled places. Only the foolish stand between a determined bounty hunter and their target.","religion":"Our faith is as diverse as our people. Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.","magic":"Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin. Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.","communication":"Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.","medicine":"Orders of sworn healers preserve our medical knowledge and train new generations of caregivers. Life-saving advanced care is available within larger communities throughout the settled sectors of the Forge. Even remote communities are often served by a novice healer, or can request help from a healer's guild in an emergency.","ai":"Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.","war":"War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops. Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.","lifeforms":"This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way. Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworldâ€”carried aboard the Exodus shipsâ€”have adapted to live with us in the Forge.","precursors":"The biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants, engineered by civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war, survived the death of their creators. On scarred planets and within precursor vaults throughout the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight unending wars.","horrors":"Put enough alcohol in a spacer, and theyâ€™ll tell you stories of ghost ships crewed by vengeful undead. Itâ€™s nonsense. Within the Forge, space and time are as mutable and unstable as a flooding river. When reality can't be trusted, we are bound to encounter unsettling phenomenon."},"progressTracks":[],"journal":[{"title":"Chapter 06: The Blood on Your Hands","content":"<aside class=\"action\"><header>Begin a Session</header><p class=\"action-item\">+1 momentum</p></aside><p><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">Zoya couldn’t sleep, thinking of the scene at the plaza, and their subsequent emergency shift at the hospital. It was a mess. Lux, the nurses, everyone was reeling from the massacre. It was a point of no return: those who lived would have to deal with a brand new world, with new rules and expectations, and it was dawning on everyone that things were only going to get harder from here.</span><br></p><p>“It’s not your fault, Zoya,” their brother’s familiar voice hummed in the darkness as the healer stared up at their ceiling. They really wanted to believe his words, but they just couldn’t.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have trusted her. I could’ve prevented this if I’d made a different choice back then.” They felt another round of tears welling up in their already-puffy eyes. How many times was that tonight, anyway? They’d lost track.</p><p>“There was no way you could know it would lead to this, and you made the choice that made sense to keep everyone safe back then. You saved a lot of people by giving them a reason to actually go in there like that.” The faint ghostly light flickered with each word, casting faint shadows across the room.</p><p>It was late in the night when there was a knock on the door. It took a couple of minutes for Zoya to decide to stop ignoring it, as it got more and more insistent. They didn’t want to have to do this. Not right now.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, they unlocked the door and swung it open. Sage stood there, as if she’d lost all the determination that kept knocking now that she realized what she had to face.

I can’t try and be the good guy when the organization itself is corrupt. It’ll just drag me down with it, like it did today. It’s too sick to get fixed from within.”</p><p>Seeing a glimmer of hope, Zoya reached for Sage’s hand.

Zoya thought of what it felt like from the other end, to feel like the ultimate arbiter of someone’s success at sticking to such a solemn oath.

There were various gatherings, as the community organized about what to do next. It was clear that taking to the streets would only mean more death. Eventually, the gatherings went from public discussions with large groups, to smaller, more private ones with trusted people.</p><p>One day, under the guise of wanting to get “something checked out”, Ria came to see Zoya in the hospital. In the privacy of the room, Ria explained how there would be a committee gathering tonight, and they had agreed to let Zoya in on their plans. They had earned the trust of this community, and they had unanimously voted to trust them with a role.</p><p>That night, Zoya reached the house she was directed to, late at night. It was a simple-looking home, though some might even call it a hut from how small and… rustic it looked. They knocked on the door with the pattern Ria taught them and waited, looking around in the empty back street that didn’t even have street lighting.</p><p>The door opened slightly, and the person on the other side peeked through the gap, eyeballing Zoya with suspicion. Their eyes eventually landed on Zoya’s necklace. The door suddenly shut and Zoya could hear the jangle of a latch being undone on the other side. When the door swung open, the person on one other side smiled wide at them. They were tall, with a messy head of hair, and a light tank top showed off torso and arms covered in tattoos down to the back of their hands.</p><p>Their voice was thickly accented. Not a foreign one, but a particularly thick local one. “Ah, you must be Zoya. Come. Hurry in.” They stepped out of the way and gestured quickly. Once Zoya made it inside, they took one final look outside and closed the door, latching it and deadbolting it.</p><p>“My name is Derya O’Niel. Welcome to my home.” They extended a large, calloused hand with slightly clubbed fingertips. Zoya took it, “Zoya Santos. Thank you for your hospitality.”</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Make a Connection</header><dl class=\"roll strong-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Strong Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">Connection created!</p></aside><p>The grip was solid and honest. They smiled at each other before Derya turned and gestured to the rest of the room, “the rest of the people here are part of the defense committee for the Exalted Shipbreakers.” They walked over to the others joined them, seated around the table in the middle of the room. A fire crackled in a small hearth, warming the small room and adding a warmth to the dim lighting.</p><p>Zoya scanned the faces, all partially in shadow, recognizing some of their patients among them. And some who were at the front of the crowd when the massacre happened. While Derya seemed pretty chipper, the others had much more serious expressions on their faces, sizing Zoya up.</p><p>The awkward silence was broken by Ria stepping into the room with a bottle and some small glasses, setting them on the table. She smiled at Zoya. “I knew you’d come.”</p><p>“I had to. I’m here as part of my vow.”</p><p>The people in the room looked at each other, some surprised, others nodding confirmation.</p><p>“What vow?” croaked the voice of an older woman from across the table.</p><p>“I have vowed upon my emblem, and I vow to you, that I will see Florin free.”</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Develop Your Relationship</header><p class=\"action-item\">+ progress Ria track</p><p class=\"action-item\"></p><p class=\"action-item\">+ progress Derya track</p><p class=\"action-item\">[everybody liked that]</p></aside><p>Derya stood and smiled, then gestured Zoya towards an empty chair. “Then you are among friends. Come, sit. There is no time to waste and there is much to discuss.”</p><p>Zoya nodded and sat, as Derya unfolded a map on the table and started to explain where and how they would make their first strike.</p><p>When the explanation was over, Zoya sat back and took it all in. She wasn’t aware they’d managed to get together those kinds of weapons or equipment, especially on such short notice. They must have been planning this much longer, definitely before the more recent Clerk reassignment. These were people who deeply believed in Beryl as its own independent world, a reflection of its unique culture and identity, one that the Wrights had spent decades trying to erase and replace with their own. These days, people who spoke like Derya were rare, even though most people at least had a hint of the dialect in their day to day speech. A few even still spoke the Old Tongue with their grandparents.</p><p>There was still one big question after all this, “And what do you need from me?”</p><p>Derya, still leaning over the table, gestured at one part of the plan, “You’re the only one with a ship here, and you’re still not under watch by any of the Wrights. We need you to pick up a shipment of supplies from Lyra and drop it off at one of our caches in the jungle.”</p><p>Lyra station orbited Osolok, a nearby ice planet in the same sector as Beryl. It was ostensibly a terraforming station, but the terraforming itself had slowed down in recent years and, as one of the last independent settlements in the sector, it had turned into a great center of commerce, both legitimate and underground. It was a great, nearby place to acquire any supplies that would be needed without having the Wrights breathing down their necks.</p><p>“They’ll be suspicious of me suddenly going off world after all this time. I know they’ve been intercepting courier messages so nothing seems to get past them, which means they know I haven’t been reassigned. I’m pretty sure they paid my handlers off, too. How am I supposed to get there?” Zoya scanned over the plans again, trying to take in the complexity of everything.</p><p>“We have some… friends on the station. They’re going to get very sick. And they’re going to ask for help from the nearest Caducean. Which would be you.” Derya smirked.</p><p>“And the cargo?

I’ll really need them if I’m going to pull this off.”</p><p>Deryl nodded, “Understood.” They reached for the plans in front of them, bundling them up, “I hope all of you have this burned in your heads now.” They stepped across the room, and before anyone could really answer, tossed everything in the hearth. The paper caught and burned to nothing in mere moments.</p><p>“Alright, dismissed. You all know what to do.” They smiled, back to their cheerful self. “Zoya, you’ll receive a medical aid summons in the next week. You’ll have to leave as soon as you get it if we’re gonna make it seem as urgent as we need. Make sure you’re ready for that.”</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>“We’ll ask you to bring your friend before that, of course, but make sure they’re prepared too.”</p><p>Deryl walked over to Zoya and placed one of those large hands on their shoulder, “And thank you. You’ve done a lot for our community since you came here. I know you’re really sticking your neck out for us here, and I want you to know how much we appreciate and trust you.”</p><p>Zoya placed their hand on Deryl’s, “I’ll do everything I can to set this right. I lost my home to outsiders who saw more value in our land and resources than our humanity, and if I can stop that from suffering to another community I care about, I will.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Teacher.

Ria, it turned out, was perfectly healthy even after all that. Zoya had sent out a message on a courier as soon as they could to notify Caduceus, but they hadn’t gotten a response back even after this long—meaning this was going to be their assignment for the time being. They’d settled into the rhythm of like in Florin.</p><p>A sunbeam peeked past the curtains, landing right in their eyes, and Zoya rolled over, feeling the bed next to them, realizing there was no one there. Propping themself on their elbow, they rubbed their eyes and looked around, “Sage?”</p><p>Someone stepped out from the bathroom door across the room, buttoning up a military uniform, toothbrush in mouth. “Good morning, Zoya. Did I wake you?”</p><p>Zoya made a sleepy whimper, “No, but it’s so early. Is something happening today?”</p><p>The Captain sighed, “Yeah. The new Clerk is getting here soon and I have to be there. You know how it is.” She went back to brushing her teeth and stepped into the bathroom.</p><p>Zoya leaned over, bringing their knees up under the sheets and looping their arms around them as they sat up. “I wish you could stay longer.”</p><p>Sage leaned her head out of the bathroom, wiping her mouth with a towel. “I can come back tonight.

I have to escort them myself all day.”</p><p>She straightened and finished buttoning up her jacket, “I’ll see you later.”</p><p>They waved at each other as the Captain stepped out the door.</p><p>“Yeah.

The Clerk is about to get here.”</p><p>“Already?”</p><p>“Yes and apparently he wants to meet you in particular.” Lux grinned, resting their chin on their palm as they leaned forward over the desk, “you’re just really good at taking my spotlight since you got here, you know.”</p><p>“I’m just doing my job, Lux.”</p><p>“Good. Just keep doing that.” Ke looked past Zoya and the grin fell right off kir face as ke stood.</p><p>Zoya stepped aside and looked behind them, where Captain Malek had just come in, accompanying a slight, scruffy-looking man who was even shorter than Zoya.&nbsp;</p><p>“Clerk Holland, welcome.” Lux bowed kir head and glanced aside at Zoya, who got the message and followed suit.</p><p>“Lux Valenus, I assume.” Their tone was dry and unpleasant. “And you must be the Caduceus Teacher.”</p><p>He looked Zoya up and down and pursed his lips. “I’m told you’re also the one who figured out what was going on with that Vault.”</p><p>Zoya looked at the Captain, who was looking straight ahead and not betraying any thoughts.</p><p>“Yes, Clerk, with the help of the rest of the party. I just helped with analysis because I was equipped for it.”</p><p>“By equipped you mean that Caduceus witchcraft, right?”</p><p>Ah. Zoya had forgotten how religious some parts of this sector, including Florin itself was. It occasionally gave them trouble, but most people had known them personally enough to trust them by now. A stranger had no real reason to have that trust yet.</p><p>They thought better than to correct the Clerk. “Yes.”</p><p>“We may yet have use for your skills, then. Once this transfer is completed, I intend to start excavation as soon as possible.”</p><p>Extraction of the Black Iron. It would be a major operation, and likely involve an influx of off-worlders for the workforce. “Do you have plans for where the new workforce will be living, yet? If it’s happening that quickly.”</p><p>The Clerk smiled easily, “Teacher. The workforce is already here. All we’re waiting for is the equipment.”</p><p>Zoya opened their mouth to ask a very stupid question before they realized—he intended to force the current settlers to mine that Vault instead of continue their current work. Most people here were subsistence farmers or other connected labor. They were necessary for the colony to make its own food. Some if the locals had passed down their traditional labor through generations of apprenticeships and were the only ones in the sector really knowledgeable on how to tend to the local crops.</p><p>What the Clerk was doing would make them fully dependent on foreign food imports, and force many laborers who had trained in their crafts their entire lives to work in dangerous conditions operating heavy mining equipment. Zoya wasn’t feeling very hopeful that they would be trained or that thorough safety measures would be taken. And the Clerk all but confirmed it as he spoke again, “I expect we’ll have more of a need of your services in the coming times. As such, we’ve negotiated with your handlers to continue your very valuable here for the foreseeable.”</p><p>Ah. So that’s why they never got reassigned. They’d paid off Caduceus. Certainly something they would be able to afford now that they controlled such a cache of Black Iron, which was a critical component in various Caduceus technologies.</p><p>Zoya felt anger bubbling up inside but did their best to hide it, and said nothing. The Clerk took a long careful look at their face.</p><p>“You may continue your role here, Mx. Valenus. I will, however, have to call upon your Teacher here on occasion. I assume that won’t be a problem.”</p><p>“Not at all, Clerk.” Lux was also hiding kir emotions as best ke could. Ke was also someone whose family had been in Florin for generations.</p><p>“Very well, that will be all, I’ll leave you to whatever it is you do here.” And with that, the Clerk turned and stepped out the door. Zoya and Captain Malek’s eyes met for a few moments, as if they were hoping there was something she would say or do. But she broke off and simply left without saying a thing.</p><p>Lux plopped right down on kir chair and rubbed kir face with kir hand, but said nothing.</p><p>Zoya decided to give kem some time and gripped their tablet before seeing themself out and getting back to work.</p><hr><p>That evening, as Zoya headed back to their apartment, they heard a commotion coming from the plaza. As they approached, they could see a large crowd gathered in the center. The Clerk stood on a small stage behind a line of Wrights troops. There were familiar faces on both sides of the confrontation: these were the local security forces. Right at the front of the line, Zoya spotted Ria, angrily yelling right at Private Ruiz’s face.</p><p>“You can’t do this! You can’t just upend our lives like this!”</p><p>Another voice chimed in, “and your deal is trash! I’ll barely be able to make ends meet with import prices!”</p><p>“Get the hell off our planet!”</p><p>Some kind of trash flew from the crowd, right over the soldiers, and shattered near the Clerk, who made a gesture and said something Zoya couldn’t hear over the rising commotion.</p><p>As they reached the back of the crowd, a gunshot ran out, and the crowd stilled and got quiet. A megaphone announced, the voice of the Clerk ringing out in the otherwise now silent plaza, “that’s your only and final warning. Disperse now. This is a Wrights colony and we have made an important determination about its future, for the good of all of us. If this is against your wishes, you may file an official request to be relocated to one of our other colonies, but you’ll be expected to carry out your assigned work while your petition is processed.” Silence once again, “this is now an illegal gathering. Disperse now or I will be forced to ask the Captain here to make arrests of any who choose to remain.”</p><p>Surely, the Captain wouldn’t go along with this, right? Zoya found an opening in the crowd and pushed through, making it to the front. The crowd, meanwhile, was definitely not dispersing and seemed to be growing angrier by the minute.</p><p>“Sage, please.” Zoya called out to the Captain, hoping she would help deescalate the situation. She’d always been fair as far as Zoya had seen from knowing her all this time.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Compel</header><p class=\"action-item\">+heart, +2 from bond</p><dl class=\"roll miss match\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss With a Match</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">…I can’t believe it</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Pay the Price</header></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Endure Stress</header><p class=\"action-item\">-3&nbsp;spirit</p><p class=\"action-item\">ouch.

They gasped for air and arched their back, as if they’d almost drowned and had just made it back to land. Their could feel their entire body trying to make up its mind on whether it was feeling more like burning or a torturous itchiness. Their heart pounded in their chest, in their ears, in their throat and neck. In their fingertips.</p><p>Their first instinct was to move, but they couldn’t. The edges of the synthleather straps dug into their wrists the more they pulled against them, leaving deeper and deeper marks, threatening to bleed if they were stressed any further.</p><p>The light that first shone on their eyes was blinding, shining straight down on her face in what felt like a focused beam.</p><p>They shut their eyes tight.

They wondered for a second what had taken over them that they had been willing to put themself at such risk, but the answer was as obvious now as ever: they were doing it for Kylar, their brother, who now haunted them in the aspect of any number of different spectral, floating, whispering lanterns.</p><p>Getting infused with medical nanites by the Order of Caduceus Resplendent was only one step towards their goal: fulfilling their vow to bring him back, or finally lay him to rest.

They felt a sense of fear start bubbling up inside them again, “How long…”</p><p>The Speaker immediately waved their hand and Zoya’s mouth flew shut. They couldn’t even make a sound in protest. She smiled, “Oh good. They’re working wonderfully already,” something told Zoya this was the Speaker’s favorite thing to do, “but to answer your question, typically a couple of days.”</p><p>She walked over to the vitals monitor by the bed and quietly examined them as Zoya watched, for like felt like an eternity.

The initiation rites still felt like a fresh wound. They wondered how long it would take to heal.</p><p>Everyone around them was tired. While the journey back was easier, the group still hadn’t had a chance to process everything that had happened, to understand the magnitude of the changes that would be coming their way very soon. Some of them had grown up in Florin, used to its relative isolation and lack of resources. The thought of it becoming a place of riches and intrigue was something they were certainly ambivalent about. Some of them had whispered of leaving before it went down, as they say by their campfires those last couple of nights. Or of waiting for the first batch of treasure to come and use that to start a new, more comfortable life with their families, back in the Terminus systems.</p><p>And so, most of them were too tired to feel the excitement when the gates opened and practically the entire settlement cheered, flowers flying in their direction, the crowd parting solely for them as the party made their way towards the plaza.</p><p>Lucas Savarin waited for them at the center, looking terribly official as someone who took his self image and position very seriously. Zoya wondered whether the Wrights would actually give this man the power he was hoping for, or replace him with someone more competent now that this place mattered so much more. It would remain to be seen, they guessed. He certainly seemed confident that things would go his way.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, Zoya was sure he wouldn’t give them the time of day once this whole thing was finally resolved and he was done with his little ceremony.</p><p>He opened his arms, magnanimously, and welcomed the group, “We are all overjoyed to see you back safely with us, and beyond thankful for what you’ve all done for us. Please, step over here.”</p><p>Captain Malek nodded, she knew the drill with this guy. Not that her face revealed the slightest hint of an opinion about what was going on. She was a soldier, a tool, and she was just here to do her job. “Atten-hut!” The soldiers around Zoya immediately fell in line near where Savarin was standing and the Captain took her place next to the Clerk, who seemed to be pleased with everything happening just as he would like.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Zoya could feel any more awkward, the Captain gestured, summoning them to their other side. She wouldn’t, at least, let Zoya’s role in all this be ignored.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Fulfill Your Vow</header><dl class=\"roll strong-hit progress\">\n        <dt>Progress</dt>\n        <dd class=\"progress-score\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"7\">7</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Strong Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+2 ticks quest legacy track</p></aside><p>Once everyone had taken position, Savarin smiled and went into a long, self-important speech. Zoya was surprised at how much attention they were getting from the crowd, as if this was someone they all really did admire and respect. They were even more surprised when Savarin acknowledged them and thanked them for their part in the mission’s success, and for fulfilling a solemn iron vow so well and fully. He was certainly a man of charisma, but he would probably not give Zoya the time of day after this.</p><p>It took forever for the speech to finish, not that the crowd seemed to mind. Afterwards, Savarin exchanged a few words with the Captain before heading back to his office, where Zoya was sure he had plenty of scheming to work on.</p><p>As she watched the Clerk walk away, a familiar face approached her, much healthier-looking than the last time she saw it. “I’m glad to see you back well, Teacher, and thank you.” Ria smiled, looking up at them.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Fulfill Your Vow</header><dl class=\"roll weak-hit progress\">\n        <dt>Progress</dt>\n        <dd class=\"progress-score\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+2 ticks quest legacy track</p><p class=\"action-item\">Will need to swear another iron vow: something didn’t quite get resolved</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Earn Experience</header><p class=\"action-item\">+2 experience from quest legacy box</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Develop Your Relationship</header><p class=\"action-item\">+ progress on Ria Arden bond track</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Advance</header><p class=\"action-item\">New Asset: Medbay Ship Module</p><p class=\"action-item\">-3 experience</p><p class=\"action-item\">Ostensibly, the ship has always had this module, it was just not narratively or mechanically available</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Ask the Oracle</header><p class=\"action-item\">What’s the nature of the complication that would lead to Zoya having to swear another vow?</p><p class=\"action-item\">Trusted information is shown to be false.</p><p class=\"action-item\">Theme: Ability</p><p class=\"action-item\">Descriptor: Advanced</p><p class=\"action-item\">Focus: Illusion</p><p class=\"action-item\">Action: Threaten</p><p class=\"action-item\">Interesting!

But the feeling was fleeting: their nanites flagged that something was still wrong. Zoya’s stomach dropped</p><p>They did their best to stay composed, “Ria. How are you feeling? It’s good to see you out and about.”</p><p>Ria smiled, wide, “I feel much better, and I hear it’s thanks to you! They let me do back home yesterday and I can’t believe how good it felt to finally sleep in my own bed again.”</p><p>Zoya ruffled the girl’s hair, “that’s good to hear.”</p><p>They looked around, “say, do you mind finding me later? I’d like to have a look at you myself back at my ship. It has some equipment that Florin’s hospital doesn’t.”</p><p>“Sure, but I feel fine? Are you worried about something?”</p><p>“Not really. I just want to make sure I take a closer look in case there’s anything you need to be mindful about. You can’t just assume you’re fully recovered right street being so sick, right?”</p><p>The girl nodded and shrugged, “I mean yeah, I feel fine, but I guess that makes sense. I’ll come by later, then.” She peeked around the healer, “but I think you have other things to do right now so I’ll run off. Bye!”</p><p>They waved at each other, smiles on their faces.</p><p>As they turned around, they saw Captain Malek there, smiling (ok that’s sus), flanked by Private Ruiz, who was also all smiles (that was more fitting). They extended their hand, “Congratulations, and thank you again, Teacher. You helped change a lot of lives back there. And save a lot of them, too. It was good working with you.”</p><p>Zoya smiled and took their hand. It was rough, warm, bigger than they expected. They had a sense that the Captain was a nicer person than they’d given them credit for.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Develop Your Relationship</header><p class=\"action-item\">Completed a quest to their benefit</p><p class=\"action-item\">+ progress on Captain Malek bond track</p></aside><p>“Thank you, Captain.

I’m sure I’ll find ways to help in the meantime but the worst of it seems to be over.”</p><p>The Private chimed in, “That’s great news, Teacher!

Not too hard—but enough to get the point across, “You’re still on duty, Private.”</p><p>Xe laughed and apologized, “Sorry, sir. Yes, sir.”</p><p>The Captain shooed xyr off, “Back to the group with you, we’re still have things to do.”</p><p>The Private straightened and saluted, then waved at Zoya before marching off back to the party, which had now relaxed into a small crowd as the other settlement folks gathered around them and made conversation.</p><p>“Make sure to get some rest in the next couple of days, Teacher, you’ve earned it. I’m sure Lux will be able to take care of kir duties for now.”</p><p>“Thank you, Captain.” They smiled gently. “What about you? What will you be doing next?”</p><p>Captain Malek glanced around, then leaned forward and lowered their voice, “frankly, Teacher, I’m going to get absolutely sloshed and try and not think about that whole thing very much in the process.” She chuckled, but there was something more serious beneath it. Maybe they were all a little scarred from the experience, and Captain Malek was still human, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, if that’s what you want to do, by all means,” they patted the Captain on the arm. “If you need someone to talk to or have anything looked at and you’re not sure about the uh… current facilities, feel free to find me. My ship has a fully stocked medbay that would put some hospitals to shame, and I’ve received psychiatric training, too.”</p><p>The Captain took a good long look at Zoya, then. Eventually, they nodded, “I’ll keep that in mind, Teacher. Take care.”</p><p>Zoya waved them off and watched as the crowds slowly started to disperse.</p><p>“They’re all right, you know,” a faint voice whispered over their shoulder. Zoya could feel the warmth of his soft glow.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know, Kylar. I think I’ll do just that.”</p><p>They turned on their heels, and headed off to a nearby inn the Captain had recommended. They’d probably be willing to put Zoya up for now, especially now.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Sojourn</header><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"7\">7</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">You have got to be kidding me</p><p class=\"action-item\">So here’s &nbsp;what I’ll do: I’ll take the automatic strong hit from choosing to swear another iron vow to resolve the complication, but instead of doing a second vow, I’m going to merge it with the upcoming one I owe Ria and make it Formidable, and that’ll be the next plot arc.</p><p class=\"action-item\">+3 health from Heal</p><p class=\"action-item\">+3 spirit from Hearten in Sojourn</p><p class=\"action-item\">Pending: swear Formidable vow involving the community</p></aside><p>They got some well-deserved rest that night, but something was bugging them and they couldn’t quite put their finger on it.

Even with the flashlights, it seemed like the light barely penetrated the darkness. The walls were rough, mottled black and sometimes a brownish color—clearly fitting the description for Black Iron. Zoya had never seen so much of it, much less in one place. They probably never would, with how rare these findings were. They weren’t sure they’d even heard of such a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Navigating this place felt like navigating a maze. At some points, they were sure that a place they had backtracked to had been previously open, only to find a solid wall where a hallway or an intersection would have been.&nbsp;</p><p>As they delved deeper into this place, something else weighed on them. A deep sense of foreboding and doom overcame them and they stopped in their tracks, gasping for breath behind their respirator as they clutched their chest. There was pain, too, and they felt lightheaded.&nbsp;</p><p>The masks should’ve taken care of this. They quickly analyzed themself and realized that it wasn’t the air causing this: it was something else entirely. Something ever-present in this space that they couldn’t pick out.&nbsp;</p><p>They heard coughs coming from ahead, as one of the troops fell to their knees and started heaving. In a panic, they reached for their mask.</p><p>“No! Don’t!” Was all Zoya could say before the panicking soldier exposed themself to the toxic air and immediately collapsed, convulsing violently on the floor.</p><p>Zoya rushed over and shoved the mask back in place, then laid their other hand on the trooper’s chest. There wasn’t much time.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Heal</header><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">-2 momentum</p></aside><p>It took them longer than they would’ve liked to identify the problem, and it would take them even longer to treat and stabilize the patient.&nbsp;</p><p>They worked as fast as they could. Even the Captain stood by quietly. Nobody said a word. The gravity of what they were doing was slowly sinking in for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>“We can’t let this one stay in here. They need fresh air and rest. I’ve done what I can, but they’ll only get worse if they stay exposed to… whatever this is.” They looked at the Captain seriously, who clicked her tongue.&nbsp;</p><p>“Private Wolfe”, the Captain gestured towards one of the rear guard troops. “Take Corporal Reyes with you and wait outside.” She looked down at the Corporal with genuine concern on her face, “take care of them. We’ll see you soon.”</p><p>The Private hesitated for a moment but chose not to speak his thoughts, “yes sir. Good hunting, sir.”</p><p>He leaned down to pick up the Corporal and foisted them over his shoulder, before hurrying off in the direction they had all come from.&nbsp;</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough of that show. Everyone, keep moving.”</p><p>Zoya and the Captain’s eyes met for a moment. Was this really a good idea? The Captain turned away and continued onward, as Zoya hurried to get their supplies back in their pack and rejoin the group.</p><p>The remaining seven of the group continued on, deeper into the dark, oppressive maze.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Undertake an Expedition</header><p class=\"action-item\">Stay vigilant (+ wits)</p><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"10\">10</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Pay the Price</header><p class=\"action-item\"> You are stressed</p><p class=\"action-item\">-1 spirit</p></aside><p>The deep sense of doom only got worse as they continued on. Zoya felt nauseous. They noticed others becoming incredibly uncomfortable. It didn’t take a nanite scan to figure out they were feeling this, too.&nbsp;</p><p>And then, as they rounded a corner, they realized: they’d been going in circles. There was a large scratch on the wall that they’d noticed maybe an hour before, and they’d just come across it again.</p><p>Zoya felt their stomach drop, and stopped in their tracks, “Captain, I think…”</p><p>“I know. I suspected as much for a while.” They stepped towards the mark on the wall. “I’m more concerned about what made this. We should try a different route this time.”</p><p>Zoya followed the Captain’s gaze. Their brow furrowed, and they unholstered their sidearm.&nbsp;<span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">They muttered under their breath, “can you feel anything at all about what’s going on, Ky?”</span></p><p>They heard no voice this time, but they did see a glow coming from over their shoulder, focusing in the direction they had just come from.

This way.” And they took the initiative to head in that direction.</p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\">“Right.” The Captain gave them an amused look. Who was giving orders here? Either way, they signaled to their squad and followed along with Zoya, everyone eventually falling into their formation.&nbsp;</span><br></p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Undertake an Expedition</header><p class=\"action-item\">Stay vigilant (+wits)</p><p class=\"action-item\">+1 Haunted</p><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+ progress</p></aside><p>The longer they went, the thicker the air felt. A couple of people had to stop along the way, but no one had to go back. Their luck would likely only last so long: they needed to hurry.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, they came to a large, domed room with a large pit in the middle. Spiraling down the pit was a wide ramp seemingly carved into its walls. It was dark enough and deep enough that they couldn’t see the bottom when they leaned over to look.&nbsp;</p><p>A voice called from the back of the group, “Hey! Look over here!”</p><p>The entire group turned towards the trooper and looked at what at their feet: a literal pile of what was clearly loose Black Iron chunks. Enough for the group to carry some back as a prize. Black Iron typically required very advanced and expensive-to-operate equipment, so finding some like this was significant: that pile alone, which the group could reasonably carry by spreading across their packs, could probably fund over a year of wages for the entire squad and their families, with some to spare.</p><p>While the Captain organized the group into splitting up and packing the precious metal, Zoya took their chance to sit and breathe for a moment. The sticky sweat accumulating under their respirator was uncomfortable and they couldn’t just wipe it, and their pack was heavy and hurting their back—And they made a good guess that Captain Malek would make them carry some of the Iron as well, so it was about to get worse.</p><p>As they sat, they took the opportunity to further analyze the issues with the atmosphere in the Vault, in hopes of finding more clues as to its nature—and whether there was anything to be done about it.</p><p>Their hands started to glow again.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Gather Information</header><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">The information provides new insights, but also complicates your quest.

As they centered themself, they felt the readings starting to come in: the strange feeling everyone had been experiencing was definitely a more focused version of what the settlement folk had been going through. That didn’t give them much time before the crew also succumbed, since things seemed to be moving faster.&nbsp;</p><p>They weren’t sure whether to consider it good news, but they also detected that the strange energy was definitely emanating from a specific point, spreading outwards like waves. Zoya didn’t have an exact lock on where that might be, but they managed to collect enough detail to point them in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>And then, perhaps, they would be able to directly analyze and deal with the source.</p><p>Zoya lowered their hands and slowly looked to their side. Captain Malek was standing there—or had been standing there—waiting to usher them along.&nbsp;</p><p>“We need to go down. And North.”</p><p>“Do you know what we’ll find there?” Asked the Captain.&nbsp;</p><p>“Not yet, but I think we should so be on guard.

This time, everyone held it together, even as the pressure from the emanations became stronger, now almost like a pounding headache.</p><p>At the bottom, they came to an enormous gate. To the North, as Zoya predicted.</p><p>“I think this is going to be the center of the place. Are your people ready?”</p><p>The Captain grinned at Zoya. Anyone else acting like they were in charge would annoy them, but Zoya had gotten on their good side somehow, so they just played along.</p><p>“Ready as we’ll ever be.”</p><p>The group’s vanguard stepped forward and pushed open the gates. It took three people to push just one of the doors open, and they weren’t even locked. Just enormous, heavy, thick slabs of Black Iron.</p><p>They immediately felt it, the waves of energy washing over them. The pressure they’d been feeling this whole time felt like a breeze in comparison. Several troopers fell to their knees, clutching their heads, when it first hit.</p><p>Zoya almost fell, too, but they’d been bracing themself, expecting something like this to happen. “We have to push through! It’ll be more diffuse when we’re past the choke point!”, they yelled, and everyone decided that was as good a decision as any. They just wanted it to be over and any relief was welcome.</p><p>As they finished making it through, they pulled the door closed again—and things improved. Having that open gap had created a focus point for the energy to rush through. With nowhere to go with such intensity, it had died does to a dull roar once again, much to everyone’s relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of them, now, the journey seemed simpler. They found themselves in a long, dark hallway. No one could see where it ended, and it was wide enough that sometimes they couldn’t see the sides, but there was only one way to go now: straight.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Undertake an Expedition</header><p class=\"action-item\">Stay vigilant (+ wits)</p><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">Burn momentum 4</p><p class=\"action-item\">-1 health, -1 spirit</p><p class=\"action-item\">+1 expedition progress</p><p class=\"action-item\">+1 tension clock, “overwhelmed by energy”</p></aside><p>Unfortunately, their reprieve was short-lived. As they moved further and further down the passageway, they only fell sicker. Zoya coughed and tasted the familiar flavor of iron—blood—in their mouth. Their bodies wouldn’t be able to take much more of this, and Zoya began to wonder if they would even be able to go back. At this point, they were in too deep: they had to stop this effect altogether.</p><p>Their only hope, Zoya thought, might be behind these two enormous doors they were now approaching.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Finish an Expedition</header><dl class=\"roll strong-hit match progress\">\n        <dt>Progress</dt>\n        <dd class=\"progress-score\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Strong Hit With a Match</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+1 box discoveries (upgraded to “formidable” rank because of match)</p><p class=\"action-item\">Cancel clock: “overwhelmed by energy”</p><p class=\"action-item\">Vault Oracle, Vault Purpose: Generation or transformation of energy, Shelter for inhabitants</p></aside><aside class=\"action\"><header>Earn Experience</header><p class=\"action-item\">+2 experience from discoveries legacy box</p></aside><p>These doors were bigger, yet lighter.

Another ramp led considerably down into a carefully groomed path. Tubes and lines intermingled with the vegetation, humming with a familiar sound reminiscent of the throbbing in their heads they had just escaped. And they let them down the path, deeper into the garden.</span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">“It’s… beautiful”, was all that escaped Zoya’s lips. Everyone stopped to take in the view.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">And then it occurred to them. Their hands glowed again for a moment, “the air is clear here. We don’t need the respirators anymore.” And they took theirs off. They took the opportunity to spit a glob of coagulated blood at the ground and take a swig of water to clear it all out. There was a wave of relief through the group as they all freed their faces.</span></p><p>Captain Malek, though, decided they had taken enough of a moment and signaled everyone back to attention, “we still have a job to do here, people, drink your water, and let’s move again. We’ll follow the path, that should lead to the core.”</p><p>And indeed it did. It didn’t take them too long to arrive at a large, building-sized machine. It was pumping and steaming and had all sorts of pipes and cables and lines and antennae coming out of it. At the foot of it, a series of panels with blinking lights and indecipherable symbols glowed.</p><p>“Let me take a look, Captain.” Zoya said, eyes locked onto the machine.&nbsp;</p><p>“Be my guest. Think you can figure it out?”</p><p>“I’ll try,” they smiled. A tired smile. They were ready for this to be over. They stepped up to the panels, and concentrated again.

It’s extracting its power from all this vegetation, but somehow still turning that towards a feedback loop where the vegetation is further nourished. It acts as a closed system. It could operate forever. I think… it’s just better to make the place habitable.”</p><p>They took a step back and gazed up at the towering structure before then, puffs of steam escaping here and there as it gurgled and sputtered.</p><p>“Can you shut it down safely?” Asked the Captain.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t know where I would even begin. I could barely put two and two together about what it does. Working with it, and what its full purpose was, is beyond all of us, I think.”</p><p>Zoya felt a twinge of sadness. Such a thing was possibly very meaningful at one point in time, now left to operate for eternity, divorced from its true purpose, left unused. And that knew what the Captain would have to do next.&nbsp;</p><p>Captain Malek gave a signal to some of her troops, “only one thing we can do, then. If this is the source of all this shit, it needs to be taken care of.”</p><p>They glanced at Zoya, “unless you think it’ll blow up the planet or something.”</p><p>They shook their head, still feeling the regret in them, “No, I think it’s the only thing we can do.”</p><p>Once the charges were placed and everyone was at a safe distance, the donation blew the device to pieces. The hum stopped, the room dimmed. And it was simply… quiet.</p><p>No one said a word. They’d finished what they came here to do, but it didn’t quite sit right with anyone. Regret wasn’t quite the word, but it was certainly something they’d wished had resolved differently.</p><p>Their journey back out of the Vault was uneventful. The air had cleared and the energy was gone, replaced by the solemn silence of the group.</p><p>They decided to have a quiet celebration that night. Muted, compared to what might’ve been for the prize they had come to, and the rewards they were not carrying in their packs as just a taste of things to come.</p><p>The Captain sat next to Zoya as the fire crackled before them that night, “you did a hell of a job there, Teacher. I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” They offered a hand, with a small grin.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoya took and shook it, “I can’t say I expected any less of you, Captain, but thanks for keeping us alive and doing the thing that needed to be done.”</p><p>“I’ll put in a good word for you when we get back. You’ll have an easier time of it that way. Maybe Lucas will even stop giving you so much shit.” She laughed.</p><p>Zoya couldn’t help but chuckle at that. Note that seemed unlikely. Their face grew more serious as they remembered something. They looked around and saw everyone else quite a ways away, then looked back at the Captain, “I could tell you were sick the moment we met. You were just gritting your teeth through the pain, this whole time, and managed to hold on even when it was at its worse in there. I don’t know how you managed to hold on.”</p><p>The Captain’s smile faded, and she nodded, trying to collect her words, “I have things I still need to do. I wasn’t about to let that take me. I refused to let it. That would’ve meant giving up on so much.”</p><p>Zoya pulled their knees up to their chest and hugged them, “I’m thankful that you managed that. I just hope you don’t have to do something like that ever again.” The flames danced in their eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>“Teacher, I would do this a hundred times over if that’s what it took.” She said, taking a swig of her canteen.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, they sat in silence, the warmth of the fire calming them as the jungle night sang its deafening song.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Develop Your Relationship</header></aside><p>They took their time on their way back to Florin.

Anyone else would’ve seen the scene as a pitch black room.</p><p>“Yeah. I am.” They pulled their sheets over their shoulders. They smelled humid and musty and some parts were threadbare.</p><p>“I’m not really cut out for this whole thing with going into dangerous places thing.”</p><p>“But you won’t be alone. You’ll have some whole-ass armed troopers with you, remember?” the voice hummed in space, echoing through the room. The glow flickered gently like a candle’s flame, but there was no wick.</p><p>Zoya planted their hands on their face and groaned, “I can’t believe I got stuck making a vow to that sleazebag. I don’t even know what we might run into. And he wants me to stick my neck out to find something that might not even be there, or that might even make everything worse.”</p><p>The lantern hummed, “It’s alright. I’ll be there with you.” There was a warmth to that glow. It made Zoya feel calmer.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>And he really had. Kylar might seem a bit different now, but he never left their side ever since that day, when the Ebon Order attacked their hometown and left them trapped under rubble—and Zoya all alone with their brother’s body for days. But during those lonely days, a soft glow kept the collapsed room where they were trapped ever so slightly lit. Ever so slightly less lonely.</p><p>Spirits never stayed behind on a whim, though. Kylar knew his sib needed him. That they would need him for a long time. And yet, Zoya’s first Iron Vow would be that they would bring Kylar back—something that had never been done—or let him go and lay him to rest.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was years and years ago.</p><p>“We’ll get through it together, just like we always have. Goodnight, Zoya.” He dimmed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Goodnight, Ky”.</p><hr><p>A loud pounding at the door woke them up the next morning. Way more “morning” than they were expecting, really. It kept going until they finally dragged themself to the door and cracked it open.</p><p>A friendly smile greeted them on the other side. Xe certainly looked chipper for someone trying to practically smash open the door with xer knocking.&nbsp;</p><p>“Good morning, Teacher. I was sent to pick you up. We’re ready to leave and we’ve been waiting for you.”</p><p>“It’s… barely even dawn. Seriously?” Zoya rubbed their eye with the ball of their palm.</p><p>“Yes the Captain insists we need to make good on time. The Vault is a days’ travel away in the best of times so she didn’t want to waste any time,” xe looked apologetic. Xe looked pretty young, well-groomed, and was definitely chipper. Xe was definitely looking forward to this, when others might be scared.</p><p>“Tell her I’ll be right down,” they started to close the door, but the recruit didn’t take a step back. Xe just smiled.</p><p>“Thank you, I’ll wait right here.”</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>“Can I at least have some privacy?” Zoya’s voice tried to hide the annoyance, really. Don’t shoot the messenger, they told themself.</p><p>The recruit immediately flushed, noticing Zoya in their loose-fitting sleeping shirt.</p><p>“Oh erm… right.”</p><p>“Thank you.” They closed the door.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>“I just want to say, it’s an honor to get to work with you, Teacher. I’ve never met a Caduceus Teacher before but we’ve all grown up with stories.”</p><p>They were walking back to the town plaza. The recruit was definitely very excited.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can just call me Zoya, really. What’s your name?”</p><p>The recruit straightened xyr back, “Private Doran Ruiz, Teacher, at your service.”</p><p>“Zoya,” they responded gently with a smile, still keeping pace with the much taller recruit.&nbsp;</p><p>“Zoya, right.” Xe chuckled a bit, fidgeting.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Make a Connection</header><dl class=\"roll strong-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Strong Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">Connection created with Doran</p></aside><p>Private Ruiz huh?

Even this early, the air was muggy and Zoya could feel beads of sweat forming on their lower back, beneath their travel pack.</p><p>“Is it gonna be like this the whole time?” they asked, checking their forehead for moisture.</p><p>“Like what, Teacher?”</p><p>“Zoya. And I mean like this, the heat. The sun’s barely even out.</p><p>“Oh yes, Tea—Zoya.

I’ll stay out of the way, Captain.”</p><p>“Good. I hope you’re prepared, we’re leaving right away.”</p><p>“I have everything I need. Private Ruiz told me it would take a day or so to get there?”</p><p>“Yes—we’ll be setting up camp about three quarters of the way there and spend the night.

They’d done their best to hold out and put up a strong front, but after several hours of trudging through difficult terrain in sweltering heat and humidity, they felt their body simply give out and everything went black.&nbsp;</p><p>They woke up several hours later, when it was dark and somewhat cooler. They were on their back, lying inside as simple tent. Tree roots and pebbles and other bits dug into their back through the sleeping bag.</p><p>They heard the crackle of a campfire outside, and the murmur of conversation. And it was so loud, as if the entire jungle had suddenly come to life with insects and frogs and some sounds they couldn’t even place in this alien place. As if nighttime was when the jungle really came to life. What was an occasional sound during the day became a deafening cacophony.</p><p>After a moment to collect themself, they opened the flap to their tent and looked outside.</p><p>“Oh you’re finally awake, Teacher!” Private Ruiz sounded chipper.</p><p>Zoya still felt gross, “Yeah. How angry is the Captain?” They straightened their back and stretched out all those bumps and lumps.&nbsp;</p><p>“Oh only like a 6 or a 7 out of 10. I think you’re alright”, xe joked, the two chuckling together.</p><p>A voice interrupted them, flat-toned, “Good to see you two are having a good time.”</p><p>The Captain turned to Zoya who, along with the Private, had hushed up right quick.</p><p>“It’ll take us an extra day to reach the Vault thanks to your little stunt, Teacher. Next time that happens I’ll likely have my people drag you along, or maybe I’ll just leave you behind.”</p><p>They shoved a canteen at Zoya brusquely, “Stay hydrated. It’ll sneak up on you. I shouldn’t have to lecture a healer about this.”</p><p>“Err.. yes, Captain”</p><p>“We’re leaving before sunrise tomorrow, so get whatever rest you need while you still can. We’ll have to go faster, too.” She sighed.</p><p>Zoya nodded, looking like a wounded creature.</p><p>“Private Ruiz here volunteered to help keep an eye on you so xyr’re now your babysitter. Congratulations. Bother xyr if you need anything else during the trip.”</p><p>Private Ruiz straightened and saluted them both as if it was the most serious thing in the world, “I’ll do my best, sir!”</p><p>“Don’t get too excited. I just need someone to keep the squishy one hydrated so the rest of us can do our jobs, and that may as well be you.” The Captain grinned. She clearly had a sense of humor, Zoya thought, but you can’t afford to come off as too soft in a position like hers.</p><p>“Get some rest, Teacher. We’ll take care of guard duty.”</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Make a connection</header><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">Burn momentum: 8</p><p class=\"action-item\">Connection made with Captain Malek</p></aside><p>“Yes, Captain.” Zoya responded right away, perfectly serious.</p><p>The Captain looked between the two, then nodded and went on their way. Private Ruiz let an actually audible sigh of relief out.</p><p>Zoya wiped her brow. Cooler or not, it was still humid as hell. They took a long drink from the canteen and wiped their mouth with their sleeve, “you heard her. I guess I’ll go try to sleep now. Goodnight, Private.”</p><p>“I’ll be in the tent next to yours, in case you need me, unless it’s my turn at watch rotation. I won’t be far. Goodnight, Teacher.” Xe bowed xyr head a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>Tsk. “Zoya.”</p><p>“Right, of course. Goodnight, Zoya.”</p><p>The formality of being a Teacher never sat quite right with Zoya, but it ultimately came with the territory and genuinely helped establish them as a serious authority when in contentious situations.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, they were correcting xyr as a bit, really. They may as well have some fun.</p><p>Private Ruiz had a subtle grin on xyr face. Xe was probably having a bit of fun, too.</p><p>It took them a while to get to sleep. Cities were comparatively quiet at night, and spaceships had little more than a low background drone of the engines and other ancillary systems. They’d never had to sleep through the equivalent of a roaring engine ringing in their ears the whole night. But somehow, even with the noise and the roots and the pebbles and the humidity, they managed to get some rest for the night.&nbsp;</p><hr><aside class=\"action\"><header>Set a Course</header><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">-2 supply</p></aside><p>The rest of the journey was mostly uneventful, though they did need to stop a couple of times to patch up some minor scrapes cuts the group had from branches and jagged rock walls and someone who sprained their ankle. Between that, and having to stay more hydrated than they expected, their pack was feeling a little lighter than they would like at this point in the trip.</p><p>They arrived relatively early in the day after the second night of camp, feeling refreshed enough to tackle what was ahead of them.</p><p>The Vault itself was a large, circular, metallic building nestled by the jungle, which seemed… oddly-colored. A circular perimeter extending about 50 meters from the site showed signs of the same corruption. On closer inspection, some of the affected vegetation itself looked… cybernetic? Metallic? It certainly looked artificial, but it otherwise blended in with its surroundings as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>A quick drone survey by the troops showed that the Vault was a sort of torus surrounding something that looked like an energy core of some sort, itself encapsulated by a translucent, solid membrane.</p><p>Zoya stood there, staring, studying it from afar, as the troops set up a small base of operations and prepared their gear—including their weapons and armor. It wasn’t the best stuff in the world but definitely more than Zoya had ever used themself. They figured they may as well be prepared too, and checked that their handgun was loaded and ready. Taking life wasn’t really something they ever wanted to do, but Caduceus knew what kinds of situations they were putting their Teachers into. This was simply a reality in the Forge—especially in the Outlands.</p><p>“Hell of a thing, huh?” the Captain stepped up next to Zoya, carbine in hand.</p><p>“Yeah. In surprised you all missed it for so long.” They craned their neck, getting a good look at the thing.</p><p>“That’s the thing: we didn’t. This thing popped up one day, just like that.” She frowned and spit something on the muddy ground.</p><p>“We’ll be ready in a minute.

This was dangerous knowledge. Keeping this place a secret from the outside world might benefit them immensely, and making a Teacher disappear would be a small price to pay in comparison, even if Caduceus were to suspect them of fowl play.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, trust requires two parties. Zoya could set a precedent here that could keep them safe—and help the patients. They may figure this out on their own, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoya’s voice was calm, but deeply serious, as they stared down the metal structure before them.</p><p>“It’s Black Iron.”</p><p>“What? What part?” The Captain exclaimed in surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>“All of it. The whole thing is Black Iron. At least as far as I can see.”</p><p>This was an incredibly valuable finding. The kind that could shake power balance in an entire sector or more. If, or rather when, the Wrights got their hands properly on this, it would deeply cement their power over this sector and expand their influence far beyond it. Zoya had to tread very carefully from here on out.&nbsp;</p><p>They looked at the Captain, waiting to see what her next move would be. Zoya was sure she was running the same calculus in her own head right now.&nbsp;</p><p>“Got it. Thank you, Teacher. Is there anything else we should know?”</p><p>It was a collaborative response. Seems like the Captain had made her choice. For now.</p><p>Zoya paused for a moment, maybe a bit too long, as they thought this all through. Then they turned and walked closer to the Captain. “We won’t be able to breathe the air in there. Everyone will need to have their respirators on. Anyone who doesn’t have one will need to stay back.&nbsp;</p><p>The Captain nodded, “we’re good on our end. I assume you have your own?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>The Captain reached into their pack and pulled out a small face mask, strapping it to her face and checking the seal. Muffled, she continued, “Let’s get a move on.” And they stepped towards—and past—the threshold, carbine raised and flashlight alight.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoya took out their own, and followed suit with the group, followed by the rear guard.&nbsp;</p>","pinned":false,"image":{"src":"/img/campaigns/chapter-02-to-the-vault.jpeg","attribution":"https://yuiwei.art/projects/wJoJeV"}},{"title":"Chapter 01: Florinian Plague","content":"<p>“We’re so thankful to have you here, Teacher,” said the middle-aged man walking next to Zoya.

I have work to do.”</p><p>And just like that, Zoya was left all alone to figure out their next steps, including where to go.</p><p>They weren’t briefed very thoroughly as part of their assignment. Mostly some basic information about the destination, and that there were reports of some kind of sickness spreading through the already small populace. There really weren’t that many people all the way in the Outlands.</p><p>Beryl was a lush jungle planet in the Boundless Drift, a mostly lawless sector under no real jurisdiction except a weak and isolationist authority that would probably meddle more in settlement matters if they were able to get their own act together.</p><p>Florin itself was more something akin to a theocratic commune of sorts: religious to a fault, in that it seemed to cause them to be more afraid than really be reassured.</p><p>In any case, Zoya was here for a reason, and their destination was obvious, even if they didn’t have someone to take them there: the local hospital.</p><p>There wasn’t really a map of the settlement. Zoya still had to stop a couple of times to get, then clarify, directions. People were generally welcoming, but they still feared outsiders and seemed to be in a rush to end the conversation so they could get away from Zoya. There was definitely some kind of undertone that the translator module in their ear wasn’t quite getting across, but that was to be expected from automated translation systems.</p><p>When they finally arrived, the reason became a bit more clear. The hospital could barely be called that. It was more of a shack, in what seemed to be one of the more run down parts of town. The people who gave Zoya directions would probably avoid this place unless they absolutely needed to come. That was a challenge. A populace that was too scared to get basic medical treatment would be hard to help.</p><p>Zoya brushed aside one of the flaps into the place and looked around. It took some time for someone to notice them and come over. “Hi, my name is Zoya Santos. I was sent here by Caduceus. I’m told you have a bit of a situation on your hands?”</p><p>“Ah yes. Good to have you here,” a pause. Ke seemed to have something on kir mind. “Lux Valenus. I’m in charge of this clinic.” They shook hands.</p><p>“I put out the request some weeks ago when we started getting more and more cases of some kind of fever.” They glanced over at Zoya. “I guess I have to clarify for you that having more than a couple of patients a month is a rarity for us. Most people go to their priest during times of sickness, but this has been bad enough that it’s left the community a bit shaken. Come.”</p><p>Zoya nodded and followed. Even as Lux spoke, Zoya was getting a strange sense of indifference. They wondered if people would seek proper treatment more if their healer wasn’t coming off as so… uncaring. There was definitely a story here, and they would have to be careful navigating it.</p><p>Before long, they were standing at the side of one of the handful of beds in the clinic, which were all in a single room with only flimsy curtains dividing them. The room was hot and stuffy and reeked of sweat and maybe a hint of death. This wasn’t a place anyone would want to spend much time in if they could help it.&nbsp;</p><p>Before them lay one of the patients, covered in sweat, deep reddish purple welts, and whose breathing seemed pretty shallow.&nbsp;</p><p>“People started coming in like this a couple of months ago. I don’t really know what it is, but on Florin, it’s not unusual to have the occasional strange fever. It’s something I’m generally equipped to handle.” Lux grabbed the chart from the foot of the bed and looked it over, flipping over a page, “and in all honesty, I wasn’t too worried about this one either, not really. It’s a pretty routine sort of thing.” They passed the chat to Zoya who definitely saw what they meant—this looked like a textbook jungle planet fever, likely carried by small, hard-to-control pest. The sort of situation you deal with using more social interventions than medical ones.</p><p>“The thing that pushed me to think I should probably reach out to y’all are the cognitive effects that follow the infection, some days or weeks after recovery.” Ke took the chart back and placed it back at the foot of the bed. “I’ve been getting some of these patients back with complaints of severe headaches followed by cognitive issues—loss is memory, or sometimes corrupted memory. I’ve had relatives bring them saying that they turned violent against them, thinking them strangers. Had to treat some of those relatives for injuries, too.” Lux gestured, and Zoya followed them to another bed.&nbsp;</p><p>Another patient lay in it, staring straight at the ceiling. Their skin was tinted slightly green, and they didn’t react at all when they stepped closer.&nbsp;</p><p>“The worst of them end up like this a few days later. Their vitals are stable, but they’re just… gone, really. They’ll eat and everything if you feed them or help them with basic needs, but they’ll otherwise just sit here, doing nothing, until I come back the fact morning and they’re…gone.”</p><p>“Have you been able to determine the cause of death?”</p><p>“No, sorry, let me clarify… they’re gone. Missing. They just disappear without a trace. Without anyone seeing them leaving, or with any trace of them left behind on the beds that’s been confined to.”</p><p>Zoya frowned.&nbsp;</p><p>“As you can imagine, this has people very scared. We’re a small community so at this point most of us have lost someone we love or knew to this, and we’ve all been wondering if we’ll be next. If we don’t find an effective treatment soon, or at least a way to fix it at its source, we won’t have much of a community for long.” Ke said this very matter of factly. Zoya didn’t get the impression it bothered kir as much as it did others.</p><p>“Mind if I take a look?” Zoya said, gesturing towards the nearest patient.&nbsp;</p><p>“By all means,” he nodded in assent.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Gather Information</header><p class=\"action-item\">+1 from Healer</p><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"4\">4</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+1 momentum</p><p class=\"action-item\"> Involves an unusual ability or power</p></aside><p>Zoya leaned over the patient and smiled at them, “Hi there. I’m Zoya, what’s your name?”</p><p>The patient looked at Zoya, then Lux, then back. There was fear in her eyes. “Ria, Teacher. Ria Arden.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you. I’m here with Caduceus. Gave you heard of us before?”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re that guild or whatever with the really good Healers, right?”</p><p>“That’s exactly right. I’m here so we can do all we can for you and the others, so don’t worry, alright?” Zoya smiled, hoping to reassure the young girl. “Do you mind if I take a look at you?”</p><p>Ria nodded. Sure couldn’t have been older than 14. This was probably the sickest she’d been in her life, even out in a jungle world like Beryl.</p><p>Zoya extended their hands over Ria and closed their eyes. Moments later, a soft orange glow started emanating from their palms, and then eyes. The occasional cough would cut through the silence.</p><p>It had taken some time for Zoya to get used to Lay on Hands after they first injected her with the proprietary Caduceus nanites. A closely guarded secret for centuries, they were an effective diagnostic tool and could even treat certain conditions.</p><p>In this case, the readings were strange. Zoya wondered if they were still having trouble interpreting their readings. As well as she’d done in their training, they were still not confident with usage out in the field, with potentially novel diseases. In this case, they were detecting traces of Remnant energy. That was not good news. If some Remnant technology had a suddenly activated near the settlement, it might only get worse from here.</p><p>Remnants were hard to predict, and even harder to deal with even when found. This was, fortunately, something Zoya had been trained on, but it would require them to find and get close to whatever was emitting this in order to analyze it, and hopefully find a way to reverse its effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoya snapped out of their own thoughts when they saw Ria had started to squirm, their heart rate spiking, sweat beading on her forehead. It wouldn’t be long before Ria—and the others in this clinic, not to mention the rest of the settlement, were consumed by the Remnant.</p><p>Zoya put on their best reassuring smile and looked down at Ria, who started looking better after the analysis was over. “Thank you for getting through that. I think I have what I need to go from here. You did great.” &nbsp;They patted the girl’s hand.</p><p>At that point, Zoya reached for the amulet hanging around their neck: the familiar spiral galaxy of her field, forged in black iron.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Make a Connection</header><dl class=\"roll strong-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Strong Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">Connection created</p></aside><p>Zoya closed their eyes again, clutching the amulet between both their hands. “Ria Arden, upon this iron, and on my word and that of the Order of Caduceus Resplendent, I vow to find a cure for you, and those others affected who might yet be saved.

Not an unusual reaction if this was the first time she’d met an Ironsworn. She looked up at Lux for guidance, who was clearly more familiar with the rituals and traditions surrounding black iron, and ke nodded, kir face serious.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Very well, then I’ll get started right away.” They turned, “Lux, may I speak to you in your office?”</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Swear an Iron Vow</header><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"10\">10</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">whooooops</p></aside><p>“Of course, right this way.”</p><hr><p>“What do you mean you can’t let me near it?

They were just delivering the news here.</p><p>Zoya’s shoulders slumped a little. “Who do I need to talk to about those things?”</p><p>“That would be Lucas Savarin. He’s the local Wrights Clerk. It’s on him to write permits and arrange other things regarding Remnants.”</p><p>“Speaking of which,” Zoya took a sip of the tea Lux had made them earlier. “Tell me more about this Remnant and why it’s becoming a problem now of all times.”</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Gather Information</header><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"0\">0</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+1 momentum</p><p class=\"action-item\"> Involves a person or faction from your background</p></aside><p>Lux leaned back on kir chair, resting kir elbows on the arm wrests and intertwining fingers. “The Remnant in question was actually inside a Vault.

Near the settlement? And you’ve only just now found it?”</p><p>“I mean the jungle is pretty dense, and some of the fauna can be dangerous, so we don’t tend to stray very far from home base, really.

This is my first time in the Outlands and I wonder what might bring folks this far out from the Terminus system.” They were making conversation, really. They themself were a great example of what might bring someone out to the boonies.</p><p><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">Polite it not, maybe it wasn’t such a great idea to ask, because Lux followed their gaze to one of the plants and simply brushed them off. “We all have our reasons, as you can imagine.

They gave Zoya the creeps, but they honestly felt like that about any military they were around. The whole concept of people whose entire profession was to take other people’s lives rubbed them the wrong way, and went against everything they worked towards. Still, even Caduceus had a paramilitary arm. Such was reality on the Forge. Even the Terminus systems frequently saw conflict: if not between major factions then between those factions and insurgent forces trying to bring about their own agenda, or impose their own leader or social order. The Vanguards of the Ebon Order, the ones who killed their brother and so many others, were only one such group of many, even in their home sector alone.</p><p>A well-groomed, very handsome man started walking down the line of troops, doing a cursory inspection. Not that he knew what he was doing or anything.</p><p>He bore the same insignia on his uniform, which was less of a military thing than the others’. He matched the description Lux had given Zoya of what Savarin looked like. That was probably him.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well at least he’s hot”, hummed a soft voice in their ear. Zoya pinched the bridge of their nose and sighed. “Not the time, Kylar.”</p><p>A chuckle echoed in Zoya’s head. The spirit continued, “look you just need to ask the guy for permission to save his little town. And he’s even got a whole bunch of goons. I bet they’re actually here to investigate that vault…” a pause, “oh! Actually I bet your angle could be that you would tag along with whatever crew they send out and you pinky promise swear you won’t touch anything valuable blah blah.”</p><p>You know, maybe that wasn’t such a bad idea. Her brother was always a pretty clever one. More so than Zoya in situations like these, anyway.</p><p>As Zoya stood there considering what to do next, their eyes met with Savarin’s, who frowned. “I guess I’m not the only one who got the rundown on who I’d be talking to. Let’s just go do this, then,” and they strode across the plaza, feeling Kylar hovering close behind.</p><p>“Zoya Santos,” the man looked them up and down. His face wasn’t quite an anger but he was definitely wary of the presence of an outsider, especially one from such a powerful foreign organization. He didn’t offer a handshake.</p><p>“Lucas Savarin, I assume? Nice to meet you. I’m sure you know why I’m here.”</p><p>“Oh yes.

That Vault is what’s causing this and if I can’t analyze and study it, I won’t be able to deal with what’s happening to the people here.”</p><p>“I mean you can’t.

He had something to prove to his superiors, and was probably not very happy to have been assigned to the boonies like this.</p><p>Zoya had an idea.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Compel</header><p class=\"action-item\">+2 from Empath hit</p><dl class=\"roll weak-hit\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"1\">1</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"6\">6</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"10\">10</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"5\">5</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Weak Hit</dd>\n      </dl><p class=\"action-item\">+1 momentum</p></aside><p>“Look, I get the position you’re in and I want to reassure you that I’m not here to undermine it, and Caduceus isn’t interested in taking any of this for ourselves. I’m here to help the people in this town.” they took a breath. “And I’m sure you don’t want to be responsible for everyone here eventually dying under your watch.”</p><p>Their eyes met, as they carefully considered each order. A beat. “Let’s talk about how we can work together here. I’m sure we can both achieve what we want better that way.”</p><p>Savarin frowned. After a moment, he nodded. Then, he turned, gesturing for Zoya to follow along. They did.</p><p>The bureaucrat led them into town hall, and their office, where he offered them a seat before settling himself on a cheap-looking chair behind a simple, metal desk. This was all clearly below him, in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>“Look, Teacher. I get what you’re trying to achieve here, and you’re right that I don’t want people here to be harmed any further. It was me who put out the request to Caduceus, after all.” He leaned back, “but that was before we realized what had happened with the Vault. We put two and two together before you got here, but it’s good to have our suspicions confirmed about what’s causing this.”</p><p>He picked up a pen off his desk and started spinning it between his fingers. “I do still think it’s important to help these people and you’re right, I don’t want to be held responsible for it, but I need something in return, “ he thought for a moment, then smiled easily at Zoya. A charming smile that would’ve been creepy on any face not as pretty.</p><p>“I want you to get to the bottom of this Vault, not just get the little analysis you need. I want you to tell me what it’s there for, and whether it’s anything useful. And if you find anything of value, I want you to bring it back to me. Do that, and the permit is yours.” He got up and leaned over his desk, extending his hand over, finally.</p><p>Zoya followed, standing up and taking his hand. They had no choice but to agree to these conditions at this point, but they hoped that whatever they found wouldn’t do more harm if it got taken out, or its secrets revealed. Savarin was playing with fire, they both knew that. But clearly the potential reward outweighed the risk to him. Or he didn’t take it seriously enough.</p><p>Either way, this was the only way Zoya was going to get in there.</p><p>“Good. And I’ll even send some of my troops to accompany you, to make sure you’re safe,” he grinned. Yeah, this was definitely more about keeping an eye on Zoya, but that made sense, really.</p><aside class=\"action\"><header>Make a connection</header><dl class=\"roll miss\">\n        <dt>Action</dt>\n        <dd class=\"action-die\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Stat</dt>\n        <dd class=\"stat\" data-value=\"3\">3</dd>\n        <dt>Add</dt>\n        <dd class=\"add\" data-value=\"2\">2</dd>\n        <dt>Total</dt>\n        <dd class=\"total\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 1</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"8\">8</dd>\n        <dt>Challenge Die 2</dt>\n        <dd class=\"challenge-die\" data-value=\"9\">9</dd>\n        <dt>Outcome</dt>\n        <dd class=\"outcome\">Miss</dd>\n      </dl></aside><p>Something gave Zoya the impression this was going to be a very limited relationship.</p><p>Before letting go of Zoya’s hand, Savarin pointed at their chest, at the black iron pendant. “One last thing.

Like so many around them, they were just another soul among the masses in the Terminus. But destiny has a way of wrecking one’s expectations like that.</span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">When they were a teenager, Zoya and their younger brother Kylar were caught in an attack by the Vanguard of the Ebon Order on their home town. The empire was using the attack to suppress “disloyalty” from Zoya’s home planet.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">It took three days for rescuers to pull Zoya and Kylar out of the rubble that used to be their apartment building. Two days too late to save Kylar.</span><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">He’d held on as long as he could, but Zoya had to sit there, wounded and helpless, as they watched their brother fade. He was so afraid, and there was nothing they could do. Zoya sat with his remains for days before their rescue.</span><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">After getting free, Zoya learned that their family had also been caught in the rest of the attack. But it turned out they wouldn’t be alone. Kylar, it turned out, never left their side. They remained tethered to this world, tethered to Zoya, where he would sometimes appear in her dreams, or in daytime visions, as a variety of floating lanterns, to speak to her.</span><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">He was there, Zoya saw, when they were inducted into Caduceus, a Forge-wide faction of healers who would send out their well-trained members beyond the Terminus systems. And he would go with her on her journey to the stars. And with the knowledge gained from Caduceus and their explorations, perhaps one day they would be able to bring Kylar back—or finally lay him to rest.</span></p><p><span style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">With the Vanguard encroaching deeper over the years, staying behind no longer felt like a choice they could make.
